# K #24: A RESTful Journey Skyward

Due **W 2019-11-13**, 8:00am, EST.

1. Procure an API key from [NASA Open APIs](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://api.nasa.gov&sa=D&ust=1573597798893000).

2. Verify that your key works by making a simple HTTP request using your new key.

    - Have dev console open while you do this...
    - Note anything notable.
    - Use QAF liberally.

3. Write a simple Flask app,

    - whose sole route
    - renders a template, which
    - displays image(s) procured via API call,
    - along with a bit of explanation of the image content. (You need only 2 files to accomplish this.)
    - File this under `24_rest` in your workshop.
